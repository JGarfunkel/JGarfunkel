Looking to work on the following:

- [beestat](https://github.com/beestat) - looking to build a feature to compare data before and after a given time (i.e., an insulation change was made at that date)
- [togglz](https://github.com/togglz/togglz) - update the togglz-console UI to prompt the user for additional input (e.g., a reason field)
- [swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api) - looking to generate a UI which will, for given set of inputs, show the applicable endpoints for those required fields
